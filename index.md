## Introduction
reveal.js is a wonderful way to create sleek and unique presentations using HTML.
There are many features available to add flare to your presentation and *wow* your audience.

#### Basic Setup
The **basic setup** allows you to author your very own presentations only. There is a **full setup**, but we'll go over this in another guide. 
1. To get started, you need to download the lastest version of reveal.js from [this website](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases).
2. Unzip and replace the contents in index.html with your own presentation content.
3. Use a browser to open and view your presentation.

#### Folder Structure
There are a few different folders to store separate elements
- **css/** Core stules that make the project function correctly
- **js/** Similar to CSS but for JavaScript
- **plugin/** Stores components that were developed as extensions to reveal.js
- **lib/** Any other third party asset (JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
